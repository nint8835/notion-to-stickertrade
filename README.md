# notion-to-stickertrade

`notion-to-stickertrade` is a utility script that uses the Notion API & a reverse-engineered version of [stickertrade](https://stickertrade.ca/)'s API, to mirror my existing sticker collection I track in a Notion database to [my profile on stickertrade](https://stickertrade.ca/profile/nint8835).
